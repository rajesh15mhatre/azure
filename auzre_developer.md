## Big picture
- What is cloud
  - Cloud provides below services:
    - SaaS: software as a service, offering cloud hosted software
    - IaaS: Infrastructure as a service, Cloud hosted infrastrctre like - server, database
    - Paas: Platform as a service, Cloud manged platform ready to develop and deploy application
  - Chracteristics of cloud:
    - on demand self-serivce: colud service can be manged by a platform from anywhere: phone/PC/Tab
    - broad network access: has access to broad network of location
    - Resource pooling: multiple customers can share a hardware to reduce cost 
    - Measured services: Different measured seriveces, can be scaled up/down
  - Deployment models:Public/ Private / Hybrid
- Benefits of cloud:
  - Reduce data center cost: 
    -  Frees up employees
    -  No rack management
    -  No setup or running on-site data centers
    -  No power and cooling cost
  -  Pay for what you use
  -  Great performance
  -  Automatic software or infrastucture updates
  -  SLAs 
  -  Proffessional troubleshooting in case of issues
  -  Security and no data loss
  -  Scalability: can be scaled up/down when required
  -  Elasticity: Dynamically grow and shrink resource
  -  Global regions: compliance with regional rules like GDPR
-  What is IaaS?
  -  On-demand access to server, datbases, firewall and networking
  -  Instanly build new hardware
  -  Provider of IaaS manages the servers, harddrives, networking, vitulisation and storage
  -  Additional services like databases or message queuing 
  -  Provision and manged over internet: dashbords, console
  -  Client is responsible for system architecture, device configurartion, OS and software license and installation
  -  IaaS is often reffered and lift and shift, beacause is closning of local insfrastructure
  -  Benefits:
    -  zero or minmal changes to your applications
    -  Easy to scale the infrastucture to meet the demand
    -  Infrastucture monitoring is provided
    -  Loosely coupled to cloud provider; easy to transition to other provider
    -  Eliminate up front cost of setting up a data center
    -  Maintain direct access to servers and completer control of your data
    -  Deploy new infrastructure in minites
    -  Test ideas on rented hardware
  -  List of IaaS providers
    -  AWS
    -  Microsoft Azure
    -  Alibaba
    -  Google Compute Engine
    -  IBM SoftLayer
    -  Rackspace
-  SaaS
  -   SaaS allows user to connect to and use cloud based apps over the internet
  -   SaaS apps can have a native client too e.g. desktop dropbox app
  -   Cloud provides creates the application and adds clud-friendly features
  -   Saas vendor manage all potentional technical issues, such as data and server
  -   Benefits:
    -  No intial setup cost
    -  Pay for what you use 
    -  Updates are automatic
    -  Cross-device compatibility
    -  Accesible from any location
-  Paas
  -  It is on demand access to a cloud hosted platform to develop, run, maintain and manage applications targeted at developers and operational workers
  -  It lets you concentrate on your application. Rather than thinking about how to strcture and configure VMs, storage and networks, a PaaS platforms offers prebuilt implementation of these services.
  -  Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastucture - server, storage, and networking. However, these peices are configured and managed by PaaS provider.
  -  PaaS can also include middleware, development tools, business intelligence services and database system.
  -  PaaS is design to support the complete web application life-cycle: building, testing, deplyoing, managing and updating.
  -  DevOps tools fit into the category of PaaS.
  -  Under IaaS we have Windows server OS whereas in PaaS we get Azure OS.
  -  In case of RDBMS in IaaS we ahve SQL Server and PaaS has Azure SQL.
  -  Hardware configuration in IaaS is specified by customer whereas in PaaS its is specified by Microsoft
  -  In IaaS customer applies updates; in PaaS Microsoft applies updates
  -  Business model: In IaaS customer buy server and licenses; in PaaS customer buy subscription to service.
  -  Paas prviders: Azure, AWS- Elastice Beansstalk, Salesforce: Force.com or heroku, Google- App Engine, IBM- smart cloud, Pivotal- Cloud Foundry, Red Hat - open shift, CloudBees, Engine Yard
  -  PaaS vendor provides one or more platforms upon which app and sevices can be bulit.
-  SaaS or SEaaS : Services as a Service
  -   Seriveces offered such as: address verification, Phone validation, Tax-rate calculation, SMS provider and so on
  -   These are services that are provided by SEaaS providers.
  -   Azure congnitive service fits into this category
-  Surveying the cloud provider:
  -  Criterial for choosing: markert share, revenue, fortune 500 client and most imporatnt one is performance in your desire serivce.
  -  AWS is the leader in overall clude serivers but that not the case for every cloud niche services
  -  Check leader under specific caltegry where you want toinvest like  IaaS/SaaS/PaaS/SEaaS
